# ClipContext - Build in Public Content Strategy

## 🎯 Goals

1. **Document the journey** - Every step, win, and failure
2. **Build an audience** - DevOps/backend engineers + content creators
3. **Demonstrate expertise** - Show senior-level thinking
4. **Create portfolio content** - LinkedIn repurposing

## 📅 Posting Schedule

- **Daily**: Quick update or learning (1-2 tweets)
- **3x/week**: Technical deep-dive thread
- **Weekly**: Progress summary with metrics

## 🚀 LAUNCH TWEET (Post Today!)

### Option A: Problem-focused

```
I spent 20 minutes scrubbing through a 2-hour YouTube video trying to find ONE topic someone mentioned.

Never again.

Building ClipContext: paste any YouTube URL + describe what you're looking for → get exact timestamps.

Building in public. Day 1. 🧵
```

### Option B: Technical hook

```
YouTube has transcripts for almost every video.

But you can't search inside them semantically.

So I'm building it myself:
- FastAPI backend
- Sentence transformers for embeddings
- pgvector for similarity search

Day 1 of building ClipContext in public 🧵
```

### Option C: Personal story

```
Someone shared a clip about Ethiopia building Africa's largest dam.

I wanted the full context.

The video was 1.5 hours.
I couldn't find the part.
I gave up.

Then I thought: this should be easy.

So I'm building it. ClipContext. Day 1. 🧵
```

## 📝 Thread Template (Day 1)

```
🧵 Building ClipContext: YouTube semantic search

The problem:
- Long videos are impossible to navigate
- YouTube search only works on titles
- Transcripts exist but aren't searchable by meaning

My solution:
1/ Fetch YouTube transcripts automatically
2/ Chunk them into searchable segments
3/ Use embeddings for semantic matching
4/ Return exact timestamps

Tech stack I'm using:
- Python/FastAPI (backend)
- sentence-transformers (embeddings)
- PostgreSQL + pgvector (vector DB)
- Docker + K8s (DevOps)

Why this stack?
- No API costs (local embeddings)
- Production-ready from day 1
- Demonstrates real-world skills

Today I built:
✅ Project structure
✅ FastAPI skeleton
✅ Transcript fetching service
✅ Embedding pipeline
✅ Basic similarity search

Tomorrow:
- Test with real videos
- Add caching layer
- First working demo

Follow along for:
- Technical decisions explained
- Mistakes I make (and fix)
- Actual code snippets

Day 1/30 🔨
